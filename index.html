                    <h3>Camp Activities:</h3>
                    <p>Each day will include two artist-led workshops for ages 6 to 9 and 10 to 14 running concurrently with two supervised, but unstructured art making workshops for the same age groups. Both age groups can attend the entire session. </p>
                    <p>Our first week is mainly focused on the interaction between stories and visual art. Our second week is mainly focused on the interaction between stories and music.</p>
                    <h3>About Us:</h3>
                    <p>Musical Story Studio uses interdisciplinary story and music-making practices to allow for a diverse range of learners to organically engage into the process of creation. In our workshops, the thematic material evolves throughout the process, shaped and informed through the various participantsâ€™ interests and values. We believe that it is important for diverse voices to be empowered to share their stories and to be heard.</p>
                    <p>Our workshops and performances encourage participants to explore their unique place in the world, and especially their relationship to the natural world, both through creative expression and hands-on learning.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Covid-19 Policy:</h3>
